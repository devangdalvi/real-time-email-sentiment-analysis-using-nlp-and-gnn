🧠📩 Email → GNN Sentiment Analysis System
An end-to-end Email Sentiment Analysis System that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to classify incoming emails as Positive, Negative, or Neutral in real time.

---

🚀 Overview

This project automatically reads incoming emails from a Gmail inbox, processes the content, and predicts sentiment using a hybrid AI pipeline:

🔤 Sentence Transformers for text embeddings

🕸️ Graph Neural Network (GraphSAGE) for relational learning

📊 Real-time sentiment prediction

🔬 Component-Wise Architecture

📩 1. Email Ingestion Layer
Uses IMAP protocol
Fetches unread emails from Gmail
Extracts:
Subject
Body

📁 File: app.py

---

🧹 2. Preprocessing Layer

Combines subject + body

Cleans and decodes text

Prepares input for embedding

---

🔤 3. Embedding Layer

Model: all-mpnet-base-v2

Converts text → 768-dimensional vector

📁 File: inference.py

---

🕸️ 4. Graph Construction (Pre-trained)

Built during the training phase
Structure:
Nodes = Sentences

Edges = Cosine similarity (KNN-based)

📦 Stored as:

sentiment_graph_data.pkl

Contains:

Node features (embeddings)

edge_index

Labels

🧠 5. GNN Model Layer

Model: GraphSAGE (3-layer architecture)

🎯 6. Prediction Logic

Steps:

Convert email → embedding

Compare with graph nodes (cosine similarity)

Find the closest node

Pass through GNN

Generate probabilities

Select the highest class

📊 7. Output Layer

Example:

📨 Email Content: "Your service is amazing!"

🧠 Prediction:

Sentiment: Positive

Confidence: 92.3%
